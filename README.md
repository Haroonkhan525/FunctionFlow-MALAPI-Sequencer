## FunctionFlow-MALAPI-Sequencer: Unmask Malicious Intent from Dynamic Execution Flow

Uncover hidden threats lurking within malware functions by analyzing sequences of malicious API calls extracted from dynamic execution traces.

FunctionFlow-MALAPI-Sequencer dives deep into malware behavior at the function level, revealing critical insights that traditional static analysis may miss.

**Here's how it works:**

Feed it dynamic execution data: Provide FunTrack output or similar dynamic execution traces as input.
Extract and sequence MALAPIs: The tool carefully analyzes function calls, identifying malicious API calls (MALAPIs) and sequencing them within each function.
Deliver actionable insights: View the extracted sequences in a clear format, like this:
sub_7FF7173B2484::kernel32_LoadLibraryExW,kernel32_GetProcAddress
sub_7FF7173B2700::kernelbase_InitializeCriticalSectionEx
... (more function-level MALAPI sequences)
sub_7FF7173B1170::kernel32_CreateToolhelp32Snapshot,kernel32_Process32First,kernel32_Process32Next,kernel32_lstrcmpi,kernel32_Process32Next,kernel32_CloseHandle
sub_7FF7173B1170::kernel32_OpenProcess,kernel32_VirtualAllocEx,kernel32_WriteProcessMemory,kernel32_CreateRemoteThread,kernel32_WaitForSingleObject,kernelbase_CloseHandle
... (additional sequences)

**Use these sequences to:**

Pinpoint functions are likely responsible for malicious actions.
Understand the malware's tactics and techniques, including potential process enumeration, code injection, and process manipulation.
Develop effective countermeasures and mitigation strategies.
Ideal for:

**Malware analysts seeking a dynamic analysis advantage.
Reverse engineers focused on function-level behavior.
Security researchers exploring new malware patterns.
